# Frontend Assignment Completed:pencil:

### Webpage hosted on http://frontend-acm.000webhostapp.com/

### Implementation of page (provided in assests folder with the name design.png) completed, satisfying the following requirements:

* Assumption: The data is already returned from JSON service.
* Functionality of adding comments implemented - (Requirement: Comment box doesn't have to look fancy, but user should be able to add a comment which then will be displayed on page. NOTE: This comment doesn't have to be stored on server - it can vanish after full page reload.) 
* Thumbs-up/ thumbs-down and stars are two separate things, one doesn't influence another in any way. This is also static content; it's not meant to rate the hotel, it's just displaying data. 
* Text expands after clicking at any part of it. (Not Required: Collapsing text doesn't have to be implemented). (I thought of method to change class onClick. Reference found: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/195951/how-can-i-change-an-elements-class-with-javascript).
* Font used is Open Sans - Google Fonts.
* Thumbs up / thumbs down / stars are all part of Font Awesome.
* User pictures grabbed from https://randomuser.me/
* Header background image - picked from Google Image Search.
* (Not Required: It doesn't have to render on a server).
* All required assets are located in assets folder (logo svg/ reviwer-pic/ commentor-pic).
* (Not Required: Page doesn't have to be responsive. Layout doesn't have to be pixel perfect.)
* It's only client side "application" :)

Enjoyed the task!
